# 📝 Resume 

This repo is actually two projects. There's a "frontend" and a "backend". You can find both in `src`. 

## Setup

This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) as it's package manager. You should [install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) it before you get going. If you use mac, you can just install it with:

``` sh
$ brew install yarn
```

Then, you can just run `yarn` to install dependencies and setup the project.
``` sh
$ yarn
```

## Running
You can run both projects at once with:

``` sh
$ yarn run dev
```

Or you can run individual projects with:

``` sh
$ yarn run backend
$ yarn run frontend
```
